# Cofea

Single-cell sequencing technologies provide a revolutionary understanding of cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell resolution. However, the high-dimensional and high-noise nature of single-cell data presents challenges for downstream analyses, and feature selection has thus become a critical step in processing and analyzing single-cell data. Feature selection approaches are mature for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, but there is a significant gap in the availability of effective methods for feature selection in single-cell chromatin accessibility (scCAS) data. Here, we present Cofea, a correlation-based framework, for selecting informative features by exploring the interaction between features derived from scCAS data.
